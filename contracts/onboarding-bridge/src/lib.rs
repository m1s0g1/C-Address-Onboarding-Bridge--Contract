//! # Onboarding Bridge Contract
//!
//! A Soroban smart contract that bridges tokens to C-addresses on the Stellar network.
//! It supports single and batch funding, cross-chain onboarding via a multi-sig relayer
//! network, timelocked vesting schedules, a referral fee-split system, and a
//! governance-grade timelocked upgrade path.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! All state lives in one of two Soroban storage tiers:
//!
//! - **Instance storage** — contract-wide singletons (admin, fee config, asset whitelist,
//!   relayer threshold, pending upgrade). Every state-mutating public function (all funding
//!   paths, every admin setter, timelocked/commit-reveal/meta-tx flows, relayer and
//!   blocklist/allowlist management, etc.) calls the private `extend_instance_ttl` helper
//!   before returning, so instance storage — including the `Admin` entry — cannot expire
//!   as long as the contract keeps receiving any mutating call.
//! - **Persistent storage** — per-address or per-asset data (balances, nonces, daily
//!   usage, timelock entries). Extended explicitly via `extend_persistent_ttl`, which
//!   covers per-asset counters, `AssetStats`, `Timelock`, `Commitment`, and `Relayer`
//!   entries for a given key (see `extend_persistent_ttl` for the full key list).
//!
//! ## Fee Model
//!
//! ```text
//! fee       = floor(amount × fee_bps / 10_000)
//! net       = amount − fee
//! effective = min(global_fee_bps, asset_fee_cap)
//! tiered    = looked up by source's cumulative bridged volume
//! ```
//!
//! ## Access Control
//!
//! Three roles exist:
//!
//! | Role | Stored as | Capabilities |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `admin` | `DataKey::Admin` | All privileged mutations |
//! | `fee_collector` | `DataKey::FeeCollector` | `withdraw_fees` only |
//! | relayer set | `DataKey::Relayer(pubkey)` | Cross-chain attestation |
//!
//! ## Replay Protection
//!
//! Two independent mechanisms exist:
//!
//! 1. **Sequential nonce** (`DataKey::Nonce`) — optional `nonce: Option<u64>` parameter
//!    on every mutating function. Pass `None` to skip (standard Stellar transaction
//!    replay protection applies). Pass `Some(n)` to enforce strict ordering.
//! 2. **Auth-entry nonce** (`DataKey::UsedAuthNonce`) — used by `verify_auth_entry` to
//!    permanently burn a `(source, nonce)` pair within a ledger-sequence window, preventing
//!    Soroban authorization-entry reuse.
